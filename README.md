# cookbook
`cookbook` is a non-gui app to manage your recipes in the terminal, written in ruby only.

## Features
* create a recipe
* list all recipes
* delete a recipe
* mark a recipe as `done`


## Install
### Clone the repository
```
git clone git@github.com:danburck/cookbook.git
cd project
```
### Check your Ruby version
```
ruby -v
```
The ouput should start with something like ruby 2.5.1

If not, install the right ruby version using [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) (it could take a while):
```
rbenv install 2.5.1
```

## Usage
Start the app with ruby:
```
ruby lib/app.rb
```
